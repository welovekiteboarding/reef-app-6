## Manual Notes

- `mix symphony.setup` will create the first proof issue through the Linear API when the team already exists
- if the team is missing, setup will try the configured browser fallback runner before retrying
- if no browser fallback runner is configured, setup records `linear_browser_fallback_unavailable` in `config/symphony_setup.state.json`
- GitHub repo creation can be automated by `mix symphony.scaffold ... --github`
- run one queue cycle with `mix symphony.run --once`
- run the foreground queue with `mix symphony.run`
